* You need to interact with the 5 panels in the markup.
* Can you bring those panels into the js file?
* Now we have the panels we can loop through them using forEach
* console log each panel
* in the loop we need to listen for a click and then add the active class to each panel clicked on.
* It would be good to remove active class before we add it.
* write a function removeActiveClasses()
* call this removeActiveClasses() function to the loop
